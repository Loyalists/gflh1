# Requirements
[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered](https://store.steampowered.com/app/393080/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_Remastered_2017/) (Steam - PC)*  
[h1-mod (DEVELOP BUILD)](https://github.com/h1-mod/h1-mod)

# Installation
1. Prepare a copy of MWR. Read the [h1-mod manual](https://docs.h1.gg/install) for more information.

2. Install the [DEVELOP BUILD of h1-mod](https://github.com/h1-mod/h1-mod/actions)  
The current release of h1-mod doesn't work properly with the mod and using the develop build is a must for the time being.   
Take [this](https://github.com/h1-mod/h1-mod/actions/runs/4478388098) as an example. Just hit the "**Release binaries**" to download it when in doubt.   
Also note that a github account is required for this, login or register one when needed.

3. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Loyalists/gflh1/releases/tag/1.0).  
**Do NOT download the repository as ZIP, that won't work, make sure you download the LATEST RELEASE.**

4. Extract the archive and copy the files from the latest release into root folder of the game, where h1_sp64_ship.exe is located.

5. Launch the game with h1-mod-gfl.bat, or alternatively h1-mod.exe and load **GFL** mod in game.

6. Have fun!

If it still refuses to work (checkerboard background...etc) please follow the Alternative Installation section.

# Alternative Installation
The method below uses English as an example. If your game is using other languages some adjustments are to be made.  
Before proceeding, disable **Shader Preload** in graphics settings while the game can be launched without crashing. 

1. Rename mod.ff inside mods/gfl/zone to en_h1_mod_common.ff

2. Navigate to C:/Users/[YOUR USERNAME]/AppData/Local/h1-mod/cdata/zone/english

3. Move the renamed mod.ff to the folder above to replace the original en_h1_mod_common.ff
